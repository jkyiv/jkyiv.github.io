<p>In the mean time, here's a quote from Psalm 127: </p>

<pre><code>Unless the Lord builds the house,
    those who build it labor in vain.
Unless the Lord watches over the city,
    the watchman stays awake in vain.
It is in vain that you rise up early
    and go late to rest,
eating the bread of anxious toil;
    for he gives to his beloved sleep.
</code></pre>

<p>We're meditating on those verses as we reflect on work and rest, two things we're both aspiring to become better at doing. When we're honest, we often work anxiously, rather than resting in the truth that the Lord builds the house. Yet what we want--what we need--is to learn to rest. The Lord has already done the work under the work, and we've entered into his rest. Yet we struggle to rest well.</p>
