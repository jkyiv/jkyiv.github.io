<p>
On August 12, our French partner, Pasteur Edouard Nelson, went home to glory,following a serious mountaineering accident while vacationing with his family.</p>

	<p>Like so many all over France and the French-speaking world, we are in shock and grieving his sudden departure.</p>

	<p>A number of people have asked us how they can give to support Laura and her family, so we've created this page to help out.</p>

<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Two ways to give</h3>

	<p> 1. The Ternes church is collecting gifts to care for Laura and her children. If you want to send dollars, you could use <a href="https://transferwise.com/invite/u/joels21">Transferwise</a> <a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a> to convert them to euros and send it to their bank account for less than a 1% fee. Simply include "Gift for the Nelson family" as the transaction memo. The Evangelical Protestant Church of Ternes's IBAN is ______ </p> 

<p> 2. You can give euros via credit card here (though its in French): <a href="https://www.leetchi.com/c/soutien-famille-nelson"> https://www.leetchi.com/c/soutien-famille-nelson</a>. Your credit card company may charge you a foreign transaction fee, and Laura will pay an additional 2.9% fee to deposit the money in her bank.</p>

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Pray continually</h3>

<p>
We know Edouard now has the great joy of being with the Lord Jesus, but his brutal departure is a source of great pain for many, especially for his wife and four children.</p>

<p>
Please be in prayer for his wife Laura, and their four children.</p>

<p>Pray also for the Church of Ternes in Paris and its other pastor, Marc-Etienne Debaisieux, and its elders.</p>

<p>Thank you for praying with us for this precious family and for our grieving brothers and sisters in Paris and in France.</p>

	<p id="#footnote-1"><small>[1] Using my referral link above will allow you to send up to 500 GBP (~ 650 USD) before you have to pay any fee. After two people give at least 200 GBP via that link, Transferwise will give me 50 GBP that we'll add to our gift for Laura and her family.</small></p>
